This is a project that allows the GTNH Modpack to be played by a large
group of users who need access to robust compute power. The user flow
is as follows:
- User purchases a monthly patreon membership to support server cost
- Patreon API sends an alert to a fastAPI service via Webhook.
- FastAPI Service updates a postgres instance with the patreon email
    and a unique password (OTP)
- Streamlit website is used by User to map Minecraft Username to email.
    This process is validated via the OTP stored in the database.
- Streamlit website updates postgres database to add username to email row.
- APScheduler runs on FastAPI container to periodically query and update whitelist.
- Minecraft server queries fastAPI endpoint where whitelist is returned.
- User is now on whitelist and can join the GTNH server.

Containers and Responsibilities:
[+] Streamlit:
    [+] Handles OTP and MCUser input fields
    [+] Sanitizes User Input
    [+] Displays Site and Form UI
[ ] FastAPI + APScheduler:
    - OTP Validation Against postgres
    - Adding MCUser to correct db row
    - Sending confirmation email
    - Returning Success/Fail to Streamlit
    - Updates Whitelist from Postgres DB
    [ ] Takes in Patreon Webhook and Uses it to update and send email
[ ] Postgres:
    - Stores all data
[ ] GTNH Server:
    - Allows Gameplay
    - Queries Whitelist from FastAPI to allow/deny players

Possible Improvements:
- Allow free access but determine a way to give paid players access priority.
- Add Auth0 IAM to the flow because I don't trust the way I'm doing OTPs.
